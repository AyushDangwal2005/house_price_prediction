Predicting House Prices

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various

features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, quality of construction, and more. The

model will be trained using the Ames Housing dataset, a popular dataset for regression tasks. We

will use linear regression, a common machine learning algorithm, to predict the prices.
